# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview

Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or subscribers in a business. For subscription-based services, telecom providers, SaaS platforms, and many other industries, **retaining existing customers** is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to churn using historical customer data. Having such a predictive system in place helps businesses proactively identify at-risk customers and implement strategies to retain them.

Churn prediction isn’t just about numbers — it directly impacts **business revenue, marketing strategy, and customer satisfaction**. Companies spend thousands attracting new users, but if they lose them rapidly, the cost compounds.

By accurately identifying potential churners:

* Businesses can **reduce revenue loss**
* Tailor **customer retention campaigns**
* Improve **customer lifetime value (CLV)**
* Drive **strategic decision-making** using data

## 🚀 Why I Took On This Project

As someone learning machine learning with the goal of becoming job-ready, I wanted to work on a problem that’s **practical, business-relevant, and deeply rooted in real-world applications**.

This project allowed me to:

* Explore end-to-end ML workflows from data ingestion to model evaluation
* Work with real-life messy data and tackle challenges like **missing values, feature encoding, and class imbalance**
* Understand how ML can impact strategic areas of a business like customer retention
