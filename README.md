# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

A complete Machine Learning pipeline built using Scikit-learn for predicting customer churn in a telecom company. The project is modular, production-ready, and follows a structured folder architecture for clarity and reusability.

---

## 🔧 Features

- End-to-end ML pipeline (EDA → Preprocessing → Modeling → Evaluation)
- Clean and scalable project structure
- Model saving with `joblib`
- Performance metrics saved in JSON
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Ready to plug into Flask/Streamlit for deployment
